            <p> I've worked hard on it. But here I am, still studying Python
                and HTML now and what can I say? That damn thing works! My blog is about 
                me becoming a professional developer and rich successful man and about my
                lifechange after all that. It's also about my life, about what things
                I can afford, doing this job, what car I'm going to drive when I get hired. 
                And also about how I can get back on track with my music and become a 
                Rock Star, doing this job as my support in the beginning! If you are still
                here with me, I'm glad, my name is <a href='https://www.instagram.com/let_me_vomit/'>Gennady</a>,
                 nice to meet you!
